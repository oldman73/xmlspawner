This public and open release of XmlSpawner, fully plug&play with official RunUO (SVN) and ServUO (SVN) - plans to be a fully updated and debugged system.

A lot of bugs and potential stack overflows where fixed, and something else was added to the functionality, all the new functions will be documented, in the wiki page, when possible, the only thing I ask is SHARE the mods you make, so I can patch them in, you will get the same from me.

Actual pre-compressed [Revision 23](https://code.google.com/p/xmlspawner/source/detail?r=23) of SVN, can be downloaded at https://code.google.com/p/xmlspawner/issues/detail?id=9
